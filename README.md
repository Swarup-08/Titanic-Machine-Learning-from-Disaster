# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
Titanic : Machine Learning from Disaster is a dataset from kaggle which includes the passengers' information like their cabin, children, etc. The goal in this project is to classify the likelihood of a passenger to survive based on data provided.
We are provived a dataset of 800+ passenger to train our model and 400+ passenger list to test the model. We have to use a classification algorithm for this. 

You can download the dataset from here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic and practice on your own local jupyter notebook. 
You can also practice(solve) the problem in kaggle kernel as well. I've used the kaggle kernal because its fast and easy.
